# Problem 12: Highly Divisible Triangular Number

## Problem Description
The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the 7th triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. The first ten terms would be: 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

Find the first triangle number to have over n divisors.

## Algorithm
The solution uses an iterative approach:

1. Generate triangle numbers sequentially by adding consecutive integers:
   - 1st triangle number: 1
   - 2nd triangle number: 1 + 2 = 3
   - 3rd triangle number: 3 + 3 = 6
   - And so on...
2. For each triangle number, count its divisors:
   - Iterate from 1 to the square root of the number
   - For each divisor found, count 2 divisors (the divisor and its pair)
   - Example: For 28, divisors are 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28 (total: 6)
3. Return the first triangle number with more than the input number of divisors

## Implementation
The implementation optimizes the divisor counting by only checking up to the square root of the number and then doubling the count (since each divisor below the square root has a corresponding divisor above it). This significantly reduces the computation time for large triangle numbers.

The code also includes a safety check to prevent infinite loops in case of integer overflow, which could happen for very large inputs.
